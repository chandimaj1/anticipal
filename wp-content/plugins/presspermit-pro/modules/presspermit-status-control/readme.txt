== PP Custom Post Statuses for WordPress ==
	An extension to the PublishPress Permissions Pro plugin, an advanced content permissions engine and management interface. 
	
	Your custom post statuses registered and implemented! Moderation statuses (also requires Collaborative Publishing module) allow unlimited steps between pending and published, each with distinct capability requirements and role assignments.  Both privacy and moderation stati can be type-specific.
